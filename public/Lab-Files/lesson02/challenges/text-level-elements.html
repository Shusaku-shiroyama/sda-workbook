    <p><strong>Web development</strong> is a broad term for the work involved in developing 
    a web site for the Internet <em>(World Wide Web)</em> or an intranet (a private 
    network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static 
    single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, 
    electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive 
    list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web 
    engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side
    /server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and 
    e-commerce development. <br><br>Among web professionals, <em>"web development"</em> usually 
    refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup 
    and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of 
    content management systems or <strong>CMS</strong>. These CMS can be made from scratch, 
    proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between 
    the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS 
    is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site 
    <em>without having technical knowledge.</em></p>
